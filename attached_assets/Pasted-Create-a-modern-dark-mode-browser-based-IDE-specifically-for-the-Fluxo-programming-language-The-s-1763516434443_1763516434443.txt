Create a modern, dark-mode, browser-based IDE specifically for the Fluxo programming language. The system should allow full Fluxo coding, file/folder management, module support, and live preview/output.

1️⃣ UI & Layout

Dark Mode theme (clean, readable fonts, no black-on-black text)

Dashboard / Workspace View:

File Explorer panel (tree of folders and files)

Editor panel (tabbed interface for multiple open files)

Live Output / Preview panel (shows Fluxo script output or visual simulation)

File Operations:

Create new file

Create new folder

Import existing folder

Save/export files

Tabs & Editor:

Multi-tab support

Syntax highlighting for Fluxo

Autocomplete for functions, variables, and modules

Error detection / linting for Fluxo syntax

Supports .fxo (script files) and .fxm (module files)

2️⃣ Fluxo Integration

Every file in the workspace is a Fluxo script or module

Modules can be declared:

module windowTools {
  export function moveWindow(win, x, y) {
    win.move:(x, y)
  }
}


Require modules from other files:

require("modules/windowTools")


Fluxo scripts can interact with workspace objects:

windows, apps, desktop objects (simulated environment for testing)

Script output appears in the Output / Preview panel

3️⃣ Editor Features

Built around Monaco Editor (VS Code–style)

Dark theme by default

Tabbed editing

File explorer integrated with editor

Supports Fluxo syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and error detection

Output / Preview panel:

Switchable between console output or visual simulation

Displays real-time execution of Fluxo scripts

4️⃣ File System Simulation

Tree structure for folders and files in workspace

Users can:

Create new files/folders

Import folders

Delete or rename files

Preinstalled sample scripts and modules for Fluxo testing

5️⃣ Modules & Script Communication

Modules (.fxm) allow functions and variables to be shared across scripts

Scripts (.fxo) can export functions to be used in other scripts

require() handles importing modules and exposes their exported functions

6️⃣ Interaction & Workflow

Users can:

Open multiple scripts in tabs

Run scripts in the Output / Preview panel

Test module communication and script automation

See live results of their Fluxo code execution

Workspace fully supports Fluxo’s features (functions, blocks {}, chaining : + (), variables, modules)

7️⃣ Technical Requirements


Monaco Editor for coding interface

Dark-mode, modern UI

Workspace state maintained (open tabs, files, and folders)

Output panel shows execution results in real time

Drag-and-drop support in file explorer optional

8️⃣ Starter Setup

Preloaded folders:

scripts/ → workspace scripts

modules/ → reusable Fluxo modules

Sample .fxo scripts for testing Fluxo

Sample .fxm modules for testing imports/exports

Goal: Create a fully-functional Fluxo IDE that is:

Modern, dark-mode, and visually clean

Supports full Fluxo syntax, modules, and execution

Includes file/folder management

Has live output/preview panel

Provides a coding experience similar to VS Code
